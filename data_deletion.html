        <h1>Account and Data Deletion Policy</h1>
        <p><strong>App Name:</strong> Security Camera</p>
        <p><em>Last Updated: December 04, 2025</em></p>

        <h2>Account Deletion</h2>
        <p>
            Our application, <strong>Security Camera</strong>, uses Google's OAuth functionality to link your Google Account. This is done for the sole purpose of uploading your motion-activated video recordings to your personal Google Drive.
        </p>
        <p>
            We do not create a separate, independent account for you on our own servers. Therefore, "deleting your account" means revoking the permissions you have granted to our app from your Google Account. This action will prevent the app from accessing your Google Drive in the future.
        </p>

        <h3>How to Revoke Access and "Delete" Your Account</h3>
        <p>
            You can revoke our app's access to your Google Account at any time by visiting the Google Account permissions page. This is the official and secure way to remove the link between your account and our app.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Click this link to manage your permissions:</strong><br>
            <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/permissions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://myaccount.google.com/permissions</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            Once on that page, find "Security Camera" in the list of third-party apps with account access and select "Remove Access".
        </p>
        
        <h2>Data Deletion</h2>
        <p>
            When you revoke access via the Google permissions page, our app will no longer be able to upload new videos to your Google Drive.
        </p>
        <p>
            The video files that have already been uploaded are stored directly in the <strong>root directory (main folder)</strong> of your personal Google Drive.<strong>You are in full and sole control of these files.</strong> We do not have access to them. To delete this data, you must manually delete the files from your Google Drive account.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our application does not store any personal user data on its own servers.
