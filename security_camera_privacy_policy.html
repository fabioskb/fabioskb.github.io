        <h1>Privacy Policy for Security Camera</h1>
        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> November 26, 2025</p>

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>Welcome to <strong>Security Camera</strong> ("we," "our," or "us"). We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application (the "App"). By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.</p>

        <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>Our App is designed to function with minimal personal data collection. However, its core functionality requires access to certain features and data.</p>
        
        <div class="highlight">
            <p><strong>Core Functionality Data:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Video and Audio Recordings:</strong> The primary function of the App is to record video and, if enabled, audio when motion is detected. <strong>These recordings are stored exclusively on your local device storage by default. We do not have access to, view, or store your recordings on our servers.</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Google Drive Data (Optional):</strong> If you choose to enable the Google Drive upload feature, the App will require your authorization to upload video files directly to your personal Google Drive account. We use a restricted scope <strong>(drive.file)</strong>, which means the App can only access the files it creates. It cannot see, modify, or delete any other files in your Google Drive.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <p><strong>Permissions Required:</strong></p>
        <p>To provide its services, the App requires the following permissions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Camera:</strong> Essential for recording video. The camera is only active when the recording service is explicitly started by you.</li>
            <li><strong>Microphone (RECORD_AUDIO):</strong> Optional, for capturing audio along with the video. This can be enabled or disabled in the App's settings.</li>
            <li><strong>Storage (Read/Write):</strong> To save the video recordings to your device's internal storage or SD card.</li>
            <li><strong>Google Account Access:</strong> Required only if you opt-in to the Google Drive feature. We request permission to manage files created by the App in your Drive.</li>
            <li><strong>Foreground Service & Run at Boot:</strong> To allow the motion detection service to run in the background or with the screen off, and optionally, to start when the device reboots. A persistent notification will always be visible when the service is active, ensuring transparency.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. How We Use Your Information and the Requested Access</h2>
<p>The information and requested access are strictly used to provide and improve the App's features, as detailed below:</p>
<ul>
    <li>To <strong>detect motion</strong> and <strong>initiate video and audio recordings</strong>, according to your configuration.</li>
    <li>To <strong>save your recordings</strong> to your device's local storage.</li>
    <li>To <strong>monitor and fix App failures</strong> (via Firebase Crashlytics) and analyze usage (via Firebase Analytics), aiming for continuous stability and performance improvement.</li>
    <li>To <strong>upload recordings</strong>: If you explicitly enable the automatic or manual backup option (share to drive option), the App will use your Google Drive API authorization to transfer the video files <strong>directly to your personal Google Drive account</strong>.</li>
    <li>To <strong>Advertising</strong>: We use the Advertising ID from your device, collected through Google AdMob, to display advertisements and measure campaign effectiveness. You can reset or disable the use of this identifier for personalized ads in your Android device settings.</li>
</ul>
<p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personal information, usage metadata, or recordings to outside parties, except as detailed in Section 6 (Third-Party Services).</p>

        <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
        <p><strong>Local Storage:</strong> All video and audio recordings are stored locally on your device. You are in full control of this data. Deleting the App may also delete these files, depending on your device's operating system and the storage location.</p>
        <p><strong>Google Drive Storage:</strong> When you use the Google Drive feature, your data is subject to Google's Privacy Policy and Terms of Service. We implement secure authentication (OAuth 2.0) to connect to your account, but we do not store your Google password.</p>
        
        <h2>5. Prominent Disclosure for Background Service</h2>
        <div class="highlight">
            <p><strong>Background Camera and Microphone Access:</strong></p>
            <p>To fulfill its core purpose as a security camera, our App needs to run in the background to detect motion and record video, even when the App is minimized or the screen is off. To ensure full transparency:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The App will display a <strong>persistent foreground notification</strong> in your device's status bar whenever the recording service is active.</li>
                <li>This notification clearly indicates that the camera/microphone might be in use and provides a quick way to stop the service.</li>
                <li>The service only runs when you have explicitly started it from within the App.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>6. Third-Party Services and Data Usage</h2>
<p>The App integrates third-party services for authentication, stability, and advertising purposes. These services have limited and specific access to the data required for their functions:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Google AdMob (Advertising):</strong> Used for ad display. AdMob collects data such as Advertising Identifiers and device information for ad delivery and reporting.</li>
    <li><strong>Google Firebase Analytics (Usage Analysis):</strong> Used to collect anonymous usage data (like session time, screens visited) and performance statistics, to understand user interaction and improve the App's design.</li>
    <li><strong>Google Firebase Crashlytics (Stability):</strong> Used to collect real-time crash and error reports. The data collected is anonymous and essential for diagnosing and fixing stability issues.</li>
    <li><strong>Google Drive API (Content Storage):</strong> Used strictly to facilitate user authentication and video file uploads, if the backup option is enabled. The App <strong>does not store or process</strong> security videos on our servers; the content is the <strong>sole responsibility of the user</strong> within their Google Drive account.</li>
</ul>
<p>These third-party services are subject to their own privacy policies:</p>
<p>
    <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google Privacy Policy</a>
</p>

        <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Our App is not intended for use by anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13.</p>

        <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>

        <h2>9. Contact Us</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions or suggestions about our Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to contact us.</p>
        <p><strong>Email:</strong> <a href="mailto:[fabiokbdlo@gmail.com]">fabiokbdlo@gmail.com</a></p>

<h2 id="deletion-policy">10. Data Management and Revocation of Access</h2>
<p>The user maintains full control over their data and the authorization granted to the App. We do not store user accounts on our servers; therefore, account management is focused on access control and data removal.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Full Deletion Process:</strong> For detailed instructions on how to fully delete your data and revoke the App's access to your Google Account, please visit our dedicated deletion page: <a href="data_deletion.html">Account and Data Deletion Instructions</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>Video Content Deletion:</strong> As videos are stored on local storage and/or in your personal Google Drive account, the deletion of these files is the <strong>sole responsibility of the user</strong>. Deleting the App does not automatically delete files saved in Google Drive.</li>
    <li><strong>Identifier Deletion (AdID):</strong> You can reset your Advertising ID or disable ad personalization at any time in your Android device settings.</li>
    <li><strong>Revocation of Google Account Access:</strong> The fastest way to stop the App's access is by revoking the connection directly through your Google Account settings. This is done by navigating to <strong>Google Account Settings &gt; Security &gt; Third-party apps with access</strong>, selecting "Security Camera," and choosing "Remove Access."</li>
